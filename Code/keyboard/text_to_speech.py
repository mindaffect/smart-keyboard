"""This module is used to convert text into speech.

The module contains a single class ``TextToSpeech``.

**Usage example**::

        import text_to_speech
        tts = keyboard.text_to_speech.TextToSpeech(connection_timeout=0.3, lang_tag='en', service='free_online')
        tts.speak("testing testing 123")

``TextToSpeech`` supports 3 different types of TTS services:

**Free offline (pyttsx3)**
 * `+` Very low latency
 * `+` Does not require internet connection
 * `-` Language support depends on OS, generally only English
 * `-` Bad voice quality

**Free online (gTTS)**
 * `+` Decent audio quality
 * `+` Supports almost all languages
 * `-` Requires internet connection
 * `-` Potential instability & high latency; is based off of undocumented & unofficial Google Translate api

**Paid online (Google Cloud TTS)**
 * `+` Stable and relatively low latency (~200ms)
 * `+` Best voice quality available on the market
 * `+` Supports almost all languages
 * `-` Requires internet connection
 * `-` Costs money after first 1 million characters/month.
 * `-` Requires account & credentials.

Follow `these instructions <https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/quickstart-protocol>`_ to get the required Google Cloud TTS credentials.
The JSON file containing the credentials should be named ``TTS-gcloud-credentials.json`` and placed in the same folder as this module.

**Language tags**

The language the TTS service should use is indicated with an IETF language tag.
A list of these tags can be found `here. <https://gtts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_modules/gtts/lang.html>`_
