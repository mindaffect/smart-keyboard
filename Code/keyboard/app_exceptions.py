"""
This module is for error and exception handling and logging. It serves as a an easy way to access log information
for certain kind of procedures that might go wrong when running the program. Most stuff that can go wrong is on the
side of user input when tinkering with the software. While all tinkering is encouraged as it is open source,
the most likely errors to occur are when changing settings in the dedicated json files for configuration.
Therefore these are caught, logged and handled when possible.

A ``Logger`` has the following functionality:
 * Functions that log for information and errors for individual exceptions in the code

A ``Handler`` has the following functionality:
 * Functions that handle errors and exceptions at certain points in the code to allow the program to
   continue running.
