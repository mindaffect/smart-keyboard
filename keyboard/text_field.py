"""This module is for text field management.

A ``TextField`` has the following functionality:
 * Graphical text field for display
 * Separation of the live and editable logical text line, and the previously written (historic) lines.
 * Getters and setters for the logical text line's state
 * Add and undo function to edit logical text line
 * Replace last word function for logical text line
 * A boolean function is_empty() to check if the logical text line is empty
 * A function to update the word suggestions
 * A function to clear the TextField
