"""
This module manages settings provided by ``user_config.json``.

It contains a single class SettingsManager.

A SettingsManager receives the already loaded in ``user_config.json`` and notifies
every attached class when changes are made to the file.

The class can be extended by any setting. In order to do so one must:
* Add the setting to ``user_config.json``.
* Add an 'attribute' to this class.
* Add a ``get_'attribute'`` and a ``set_'attribute'`` method to this class.
* Add the ``set_'attribute'`` method to the ``setting_to_function`` attribute.
* Pass the SettingsManager to the class that wants to be notified when changes are made to ``user_config.json``.
* Attach 'that class' to the SettingsManager by calling ``SettingsManager.attach('that class')``.
* Implement an 'update' method in 'that class' to be notified when (specific/used) settings are changed.
* For an example see ``text_to_speech.py``.
