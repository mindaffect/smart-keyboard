The /Code/ directory contains the latest version of our repositories master branch. To avoid confusion: it also contains a /docs/ directory, which has the sources that Sphinx uses to build the documentation pages. (To run the keyboard: run bci_keyboard.py)

/Documentation/ contains the latest *build* of the code documentation pages, open the index.html file to start. 
The directory also contains the User Guide/Documentation and the System Documentation. 

Finally, the /Reports/ directory contains some reports that were written during this project. Some were written in correspondence with MindAffect, some for internal use which may also be of use to MindAffect. It is important to keep in mind that the licenses report is outdated, however we think it might still be useful.
