The /Code/ directory contains the latest version of our repositories master branch. To avoid confusion: it also contains a /docs/ directory, which has the sources that Sphinx uses to build the documentation pages. (To run the keyboard: run bci_keyboard.py)

/Documentation/ contains the latest *build* of the code documentation pages, open the index.html file to start. 
The directory also contains the User Guide/Documentation and the System Documentation.
